# competitive-edge-gaming-forum

## Description

This is a simple gaming forum where you can go to discuss topics about your favorite games. As of right now the application is still in early development stages and only has a handful of games to discuss including Call of Duty, Escape from Tarkov, Elden Ring, Valorant and League of Legends. The whole idea behind creating this application is to have a place you can go to discuss topics about certain games and get real time feedback from other people from around the world playing and discussing the same games. We're hoping you will be able to use our application to further your understanding of the games and game mechanics by talking to like minded people with like interests and gaming habits. Hopefully you find this application as usefull as it was meant to be.

## Usage

To use this application you will simply click the link at the bottom of the page, create an account and then you can begin chatting with people about the games we have implemented at the time. Eventually we hope you'll be able to go to our application and learn more about the game your playing such as what build information you're looking for or just game information in general. Our goal is to give people a place to go to discuss in detail about various games and game mechanics or maybe even find some squad mates for some of the games!

## Future Development

Some of our goals for future development are but not limited to:

- Add more games to the list of discussions.

- Add the ability to have discussion tags and relevant topics search.

- Add a portion to each game containing facts and simple walkthroughs.

- Add a portion to each applicable game that will have build guides and item information about different weapons, armors, spells etc. all in one page with searchable topics.
